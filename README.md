## What is SendPrincScreenKey app for?
At least on my ASUS laptop, there is no print-screen key, only a "snippet tool" key which I couldn't figure out how to re-map to a regular print-screen. This prevented me from using [Greenshot](https://github.com/greenshot/greenshot) comfortably and this little tool was born.
